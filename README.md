## Previous Research

For this project, I am using some data gathered in the DACSS 602 course "Research Design".  In the project for that course, my team and I posed the question:

*How did the sentiment of news reporting on the U.S. withdrawal of Afghanistan shift over the period between when it was agreed upon between ex-President Trump and when it was executed by President Biden?*

**Basic Research Design:**  Text Coding with Accompanying Survey

**Text Coding Method:**  We analyzed news coverage of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the period leading up to and following the day the last of the U.S. forces left Aghanistan. 

**Data Sample:**  We coded articles that mention Afghanistan from the time of the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020) through September 30, 2021, following the Congressional testimonies conducted September 28-29, 2021 regarding the withdrawal. The articles were collected from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal World and News sections.

**Methods/Text Coding Categories:**

Source: Whether the article is from the New York Times or Wall Street Journal
Military Source: Whether there is a quote from a U.S.  military spokesperson, leader, or commander	
Conflict Veteran Source: 	Whether there is a quote from a U.S. military veteran who served in Afghanistan	
Emotionality Rating:	How the coder felt while reading the article
		
**Outcomes:**  

The article source (NYT v. WSJ) served as a moderator, with the outcomes being the analysis of media frames ‘before and after’ (Trump admin v. Biden admin). 

## Current Project

I continued down the same path but with new data and a new direction through the DACSS 697D course "Text as Data".

More background data can be found in [this series of posts](https://www.kristinabecvar.com/) from my academic blog.
