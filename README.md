# NYT-Analysis

## Previous Research

For this project, I am using some data gathered in the DACSS 602 course "Research Design".  In the project for that course, my team and I posed the question:

*How did the sentiment of news reporting on the U.S. withdrawal of Afghanistan shift over the period between when it was agreed upon between ex-President Trump and when it was executed by President Biden?*

**Basic Research Design:**  Text Coding with Accompanying Survey

**Text Coding Method:**  We analyzed news coverage of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the period leading up to and following the day the last of the U.S. forces left Aghanistan. 

**Data Sample:**  We coded articles that mention Afghanistan from the time of the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020) through September 30, 2021, following the Congressional testimonies conducted September 28-29, 2021 regarding the withdrawal. The articles were collected from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal World and News sections.

**Methods/Text Coding Categories:**

Source: Whether the article is from the New York Times or Wall Street Journal
Military Source: Whether there is a quote from a U.S.  military spokesperson, leader, or commander	
Conflict Veteran Source: 	Whether there is a quote from a U.S. military veteran who served in Afghanistan	
Emotionality Rating:	How the coder felt while reading the article
		
**Outcomes:**  

The article source (NYT v. WSJ) served as a moderator, with the outcomes being the analysis of media frames ‘before and after’ (Trump admin v. Biden admin). 

## Current Project

I continued down the same path but with new data and a new direction through the DACSS 697D course "Text as Data".

This stage of the project examines the difference in headlines between the paper and online versions of the New York Times articles surrounding and related to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The analysis includes articles that mention “Afghanistan” from the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020) through September 30, 2021, following the Congressional testimonies conducted September 28-29, 2021, regarding the withdrawal. The data analyzed will constitute a corpus obtained through the New York Times API, including both versions of each headline to conduct sentiment analysis. Multiple analyses will be demonstrated to find whether the NYT uses different title structures online vs. print to invoke different feelings depending on its audience.
