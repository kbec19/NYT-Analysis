For this project, I am using some data gathered in the DACSS 602 course "Research Design". 

I continued down the same path but with new data and a new direction through the DACSS 697D course "Text as Data".

More background data can be found in [this series of posts](https://www.kristinabecvar.com/blog.html#category:text as data){target="_blank"} from my academic blog.
