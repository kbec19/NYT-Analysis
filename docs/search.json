In the project for that course, my team and I\r\nposed the question:\r\nHow did the sentiment of news reporting on the U.S. withdrawal of\r\nAfghanistan shift over the period between when it was agreed upon\r\nbetween ex-President Trump and when it was executed by President\r\nBiden?\r\nBasic Research Design: Text Coding with Accompanying\r\nSurvey\r\nText Coding Method: We analyzed news coverage of the\r\nU.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the period leading up to and\r\nfollowing the day the last of the U.S. forces left Aghanistan.\r\nData Sample: We coded articles that mention\r\nAfghanistan from the time of the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020)\r\nthrough September 30, 2021, following the Congressional testimonies\r\nconducted September 28-29, 2021 regarding the withdrawal. The articles\r\nwere collected from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal World\r\nand News sections.\r\nMethods/Text Coding Categories:\r\nSource: Whether the article is from the New York Times or Wall Street\r\nJournal Military Source: Whether there is a quote from a U.S. military\r\nspokesperson, leader, or commander\r\nConflict Veteran Source: Whether there is a quote from a U.S. military\r\nveteran who served in Afghanistan Emotionality Rating: How the coder\r\nfelt while reading the article\r\nOutcomes:\r\nThe article source (NYT v. WSJ) served as a moderator, with the\r\noutcomes being the analysis of media frames ‘before and after’ (Trump\r\nadmin v. Biden admin).\r\nCurrent Project\r\nI continued down the same path but with new data and a new direction\r\nthrough the DACSS 697D course “Text as Data”.\r\nThis stage of the project examines the difference in headlines\r\nbetween the paper and online versions of the New York Times articles\r\nsurrounding and related to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from\r\nAfghanistan. The analysis includes articles that mention “Afghanistan”\r\nfrom the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020) through September 30, 2021,\r\nfollowing the Congressional testimonies conducted September 28-29, 2021,\r\nregarding the withdrawal. The data analyzed will constitute a corpus\r\nobtained through the New York Times API, including both versions of each\r\nheadline to conduct sentiment analysis. Multiple analyses will be\r\ndemonstrated to find whether the NYT uses different title structures\r\nonline vs. print to invoke different feelings depending on its\r\naudience.\r\nMore background data can be found in this series of posts from my\r\nacademic blog.\r\nCitations:\r\nThis research makes use of the NRC\r\nWord-Emotion Association Lexicon, created by Saif Mohammad and Peter\r\nTurney at the National Research Council Canada.\r\nThis research makes use of the Bing\r\nLexicon.
