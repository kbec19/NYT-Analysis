In the project for that course, our research\r\ngroup posed the question:\r\nHow did the sentiment of news reporting on the U.S. withdrawal of\r\nAfghanistan shift over the period between when it was agreed upon\r\nbetween ex-President Trump and when it was executed by President\r\nBiden?\r\nBasic Research Design: Manual coding of a\r\nstratified, representative sample of 300 articles after reaching an\r\nappropriate inter-coder reliability rating.\r\nData Sample: We coded articles that mention\r\nAfghanistan from the time of the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020)\r\nthrough September 30, 2021, following the Congressional testimonies\r\nconducted September 28-29, 2021 regarding the withdrawal. The articles\r\nwere collected from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal World\r\nand News sections.\r\nText Coding Method: We used NVivo 12 to code news\r\narticles covering the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the period\r\nleading up to and following the day the last of the U.S. forces left\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMethods/Text Coding Categories:\r\nGround Source: When the reporting is on location\r\nMilitary Source: When there is a quote from a U.S. military\r\nspokesperson, leader, or commander\r\nConflict Veteran Source: When there is a quote from a U.S. military\r\nveteran who served in Afghanistan\r\nFraming: When there is a framing of the Taliban as a threat\r\nSentiment Rating: How the coder felt while reading the article\r\nOutcomes:\r\nThe article source (NYT v. WSJ) served as a moderator, with the\r\noutcomes being the analysis of media frames ‘before and after’ (Trump\r\nadmin v. Biden admin).\r\nCurrent Project\r\nI continued down the same path but with new data and a new direction\r\nthrough the DACSS 697D course “Text as Data”.\r\nThis project examines the difference in headlines between the paper\r\nand online versions of the New York Times articles related to the\r\nwithdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The analysis includes\r\narticles that mention “Afghanistan” from the time of the Doha Agreement\r\n(February 29, 2020) through September 30, 2021, following the\r\nCongressional testimonies conducted September 28-29, 2021.\r\nAnalysis of a corpus compiled from data obtained through the New York\r\nTimes API showed no statistically significant differences in the\r\nheadlines using three widely used sentiment and emotion lexicons.\r\nTopic modeling and examining a co-occurrence matrix of each set of\r\nheadlines showed patterns in which types of words are chosen for the\r\nrespective audience.\r\nSpecifically, this preliminary analysis showed that print headlines\r\nmight carry fewer emotionally weighted words than online headlines.\r\nCitations:\r\nThis research makes use of the NRC\r\nWord-Emotion Association Lexicon, created by Saif Mohammad and Peter\r\nTurney at the National Research Council Canada.\r\nThis research makes use of the Bing\r\nLexicon. This dataset was first published in Minqing Hu and Bing\r\nLiu, ``Mining and summarizing customer reviews.’’, Proceedings of the\r\nACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data\r\nMining (KDD-2004), 2004.\r\nThis research makes use of the AFINN\r\nLexicon, Nielsen, F.
