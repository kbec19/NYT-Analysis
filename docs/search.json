In the project for that course, my team and I\r\nposed the question:\r\nHow did the sentiment of news reporting on the U.S. withdrawal of\r\nAfghanistan shift over the period between when it was agreed upon\r\nbetween ex-President Trump and when it was executed by President\r\nBiden?\r\nBasic Research Design: Text Coding with Accompanying\r\nSurvey\r\nText Coding Method: We analyzed news coverage of the\r\nU.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during the period leading up to and\r\nfollowing the day the last of the U.S. forces left Aghanistan.\r\nData Sample: We coded articles that mention\r\nAfghanistan from the time of the Doha Agreement (February 29, 2020)\r\nthrough September 30, 2021, following the Congressional testimonies\r\nconducted September 28-29, 2021 regarding the withdrawal. The articles\r\nwere collected from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal World\r\nand News sections.\r\nMethods/Text Coding Categories:\r\nSource: Whether the article is from the New York Times or Wall Street\r\nJournal Military Source: Whether there is a quote from a U.S. military\r\nspokesperson, leader, or commander\r\nConflict Veteran Source: Whether there is a quote from a U.S. military\r\nveteran who served in Afghanistan Emotionality Rating: How the coder\r\nfelt while reading the article\r\nOutcomes:\r\nThe article source (NYT v. WSJ) served as a moderator, with the\r\noutcomes being the analysis of media frames ‘before and after’ (Trump\r\nadmin v. Biden admin).\r\nCurrent Project\r\nI continued down the same path but with new data and a new direction\r\nthrough the DACSS 697D course “Text as Data”.\r\nMore background data can be found in this series of posts from my\r\nacademic blog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
